# What is Dabao?

**Dabao** is a tool to build web bundle easily and simple, which is based on [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) currently.

## Background

Today's web bundling job is too fragmented, over-designed and hard to learn. Each repo has its own special complex bundle config.

**Dabao** is born to bring a simpler way to config webpack to make it easy to learn, read, create and maintain.

You can read [getting started](getting-started.md) to begin.

## Principles

The keypoint of **Dabao** is radical tradeoffs between necessity and fragmentation. It locks some doors which seems easily to be added but hard to maintain and hard to communicate/collaborate with other projects. At the same time the requirements under them could be solved in another way more clear and maintainable without complicating webpack config.

Another thing Dadao does is make the config more clear and easy for common usage. It find some options which has values for many different situations strictly speaking but only one of them web developers often use.

So if you may find something in **Dabao** different to your habit and no way to customize. But in another way it take you to some habits more common which can give you more common senses and be able to take more attentions to the code you really care about.

Each tradeoff above has an article here to explain and help you understand why **Dabao** do this.

And any opinions and ideas is welcome.

Hope you like it.
