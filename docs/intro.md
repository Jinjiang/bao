# What is Dabao?

Dabao is a tool to build web bundle easily and simple, which is based on [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) currently.

Today's web bundling job is too fragmented, over-designed and hard to learn. Each repo has its own special complex bundle config.

Dabao is born to simplify the webpack config to make the solution easy to learn, read, create and maintain.
